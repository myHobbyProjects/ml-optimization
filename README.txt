README
This README provides instruction on how to run the Jupiter notebooks for this project.

1. There are two parts of this project.
  a. For part1 Optimization of Neural Network using Randomized Optimization methods.
    classifier_nn_with_mlrose.ipynb is the source file that implements this part.

  b. Optimization Problems - Three optimization problems are implemented in three Jupyter notebook files.
     problem_1.ipynb 
     problem_2.ipynb 
     problem_3.ipynb 


2. All the notebooks uses MLROSE and SCIKIT-LEARN package from python.

3. matplotlib pilot is used extensively to plot the graphs.

4. Dataset for classifier_1 is obtained from SKLEARN API load_breast_cancer(). Documentation of the API can be found here:
https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.datasets.load_breast_cancer.html

5. You will need the following packages to execute the project.
  - Jupyter
  - mlrose
  - sklearn
  - matplotlib
  - numpy
